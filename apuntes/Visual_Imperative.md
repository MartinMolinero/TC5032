# Importance of visual design
- Many elements go into design an effective data visualization:
	- appropriate use of color and techniques
	- Affect of typographies and design building blocks
		- Lines
		- contrast
		- forms
	- data visualization best practices 

## Data visualization is a beautiful science
- Humans are visual creatures by nature
- Brains are the best tool for encoding and making sense of info.
- Pictures are powerful in any of their uses: art, memories or instructional illustrations.
- Image saliency: ability to remember upward of 10,000 images with an 83% accuracy. Pictures are better than words.
- Picture superiority effect
- After 3 days of reading, we remember:
	- 10% text only
	- 65% text + picture
- Best data visualizations are designed to take advantage of preattentive features, limited set of visual properties detected rapidly and accurately by our visual sistem. Not constrained by the display size

## Key cognitive elements in visualization
- 3 most important cognitive elements of visual analysis:
	- Pattern recognition
	- Color use
	- Counting
- Data vis work to establish visual dialog
- Two way dialog leverages our cognitive visual hardwiring and power of perception
- Have a conversation with the data
- Dialog -> glean information in salient, memorable and lasting ways.
- Adds meaning, emotion and understanding to transform information from mundate data to creative palette by which to present it.
- Data visualizations are storytelling mechanisms

# Data visualization
- We visualize data to tell a story

## Importance of visualizations in business
- Can communicate more information than a table in a smaller space. More effective.
- Edward Tufte: "Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space."

## Goals in data visualization
### Explanatory: 
- Meant to direct the viewer in a defined path
- Business dashboards 
- Question -> visualization -> answer
- Used to:
	- Answer a question
	- Support a decision
	- Communicate information
	- Increase efficiency
### Exploratory:
- Offer the viewer many dimensions to a data set, compares multiple data sets
- Explore visual, ask questions and find answers to questions.
- Familiarizing with visualization -> identifies area of interest -> explores visualization -> finds answer -> explore other areas
- Can be cyclical without specific end point.
- Find many insights and interact to understand better.
- Used to
	- Explore and discover
	- Pose new questions
- Not as popular but have gained presence with rise of big data.

## Mechanics to process visual information
### Eyesight and memory working in parallel
- Massively parallel processing -> used in MapReduce
	- Breaking data into smaller units
	- Process each unit in parallel
- Similar process to process information from our vision
	- Look at visual
	- Eyes and brain break into small parts
	- Brain & eyes process parts in parallel
### Role of memory in vision
#### Long-term memory
- Formed by past interactions and experiences
- Considered when designing layout of dashboard
- Good reason to go contrary to it when deciding dashboard structure
#### Working memory
- Stores information we need at moment
- Breaks visuals into smaller chunks
- Only 3 chunks can be held at a time.
	- Limit the number of chunks when designing a dashboard
	- Pack as much information in each chunk

### Preattentive attributes & working memory
- Basing building blocks of visualization process -> Preattentive attributes
- They immediately catch your eye in the visualization. Perceived in < 10 ms
#### Preattentive attributes
- ##### Form
	- Orientation
	- Line length
	- Line width
	- Size
	- Shape
	- Curvature
	- Added Marks
	- Enclosure
- ##### Color
	- Intensity
	- Hue
- ##### Spatial position
	- 2D position
- Important when analyzing visualizations.
- Only position & length used to perceive quantitative data with precision.
- Other attributes are useful for perceiving other types of data
	- Categorical
	- Relational
- Considering attributes help to decide which chart type to use

### Forming Analytical Patterns Out of Preattentive Attributes
Preattentive attributes -> alphabets of visual language.
Analytical patterns -> words formed by using them.

- When crafting visualizations we can hightlight patterns above others: Gestalt's Principles
### Using the Gestalt Principles to Bring Out Patterns in Visualizations
- Gestalt principles: How mind organizes elements into groups
- Highlight important patterns and downpay others.

- Principles help perform tasks like reduuce noise from charts, choose aspect ratio, show relationships between elements.
